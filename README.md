# WP API Posts

This is a small class that is used to grab posts from the WP API and comes in handy if you want to add a blog to a static site.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To use this you will need to have a WordPress blog and a static web page where you want the posts from the blog to show up.

```
The page should be PHP or if the page is html then you can create a php page and build out the request using JS to get the results using ajax and output to the page.
```

### Installing
